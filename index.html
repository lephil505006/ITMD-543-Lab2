    <h1>Skills and Works of Philip Le</h1>
    <p>As a brief intro, I am a co-terminal student in my 5th year working for my ITM Major and Web App Masters.
        <br>As of now, I am trying to focus on more UX/UI type work and I hope this class can help me further improve my
        design skills.
        <br>Since I'm part of the 02 section of this course, I'm not really in person so I'd thought it'd be nice to
        show a photo of myself below!
